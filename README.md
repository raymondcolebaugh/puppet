# Puppet Modules
This is a collection of simple puppet modules for quickly deploying
services on development and production machines running Debian,
Ubuntu, Red Hat, and CentOS GNU/Linux.

*Warning: these manifests are not yet tuned for security.*

Most of these modules should be simply included, very few take
parameters. Right now operating system support is in favor of
Debian/Ubuntu. Documentation will be coming soon.
